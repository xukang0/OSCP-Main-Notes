## Blacklisting Extensions

Let's start by trying one of the client-side bypasses we learned in the previous section to upload a PHP script to the back-end server. We'll intercept an image upload request with Burp, replace the file content and filename with our PHP script's, and forward the request:

   

![Update profile image with upload button; extension not allowed.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/136/file_uploads_disallowed_type.jpg)

As we can see, our attack did not succeed this time, as we got `Extension not allowed`. This indicates that the web application may have some form of file type validation on the back-end, in addition to the front-end validations.

There are generally two common forms of validating a file extension on the back-end:

1. Testing against a `blacklist` of types
2. Testing against a `whitelist` of types

Furthermore, the validation may also check the `file type` or the `file content` for type matching. The weakest form of validation amongst these is `testing the file extension against a blacklist of extension` to determine whether the upload request should be blocked. For example, the following piece of code checks if the uploaded file extension is `PHP` and drops the request if it is:

Code: php

```php
$fileName = basename($_FILES["uploadFile"]["name"]);
$extension = pathinfo($fileName, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
$blacklist = array('php', 'php7', 'phps');

if (in_array($extension, $blacklist)) {
    echo "File type not allowed";
    die();
}
```

The code is taking the file extension (`$extension`) from the uploaded file name (`$fileName`) and then comparing it against a list of blacklisted extensions (`$blacklist`). However, this validation method has a major flaw. `It is not comprehensive`, as many other extensions are not included in this list, which may still be used to execute PHP code on the back-end server if uploaded.

**Tip:** The comparison above is also case-sensitive, and is only considering lowercase extensions. In Windows Servers, file names are case insensitive, so we may try uploading a `php` with a mixed-case (e.g. `pHp`), which may bypass the blacklist as well, and should still execute as a PHP script.

So, let's try to exploit this weakness to bypass the blacklist and upload a PHP file.

## Fuzzing Extensions

As the web application seems to be testing the file extension, our first step is to fuzz the upload functionality with a list of potential extensions and see which of them return the previous error message. Any upload requests that do not return an error message, return a different message, or succeed in uploading the file, may indicate an allowed file extension.

There are many lists of extensions we can utilize in our fuzzing scan. `PayloadsAllTheThings` provides lists of extensions for [PHP](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Extension%20PHP/extensions.lst) and [.NET](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Extension%20ASP) web applications. We may also use `SecLists` list of common [Web Extensions](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt).

We may use any of the above lists for our fuzzing scan. As we are testing a PHP application, we will download and use the above [PHP](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Extension%20PHP/extensions.lst) list. Then, from `Burp History`, we can locate our last request to `/upload.php`, right-click on it, and select `Send to Intruder`. From the `Positions` tab, we can `Clear` any automatically set positions, and then select the `.php` extension in `filename="HTB.php"` and click the `Add` button to add it as a fuzzing position:

   

![HTTP POST request to /upload.php with file HTB$.php$, attack type Sniper.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/136/file_uploads_burp_fuzz_extension.jpg)

We'll keep the file content for this attack, as we are only interested in fuzzing file extensions. Finally, we can `Load` the PHP extensions list from above in the `Payloads` tab under `Payload Options`. We will also un-tick the `URL Encoding` option to avoid encoding the (`.`) before the file extension. Once this is done, we can click on `Start Attack` to start fuzzing for file extensions that are not blacklisted:

   

![Table of payloads with HTTP status 200, file successfully uploaded.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/136/file_uploads_burp_intruder_result.jpg)

We can sort the results by `Length`, and we will see that all requests with the Content-Length (`193`) passed the extension validation, as they all responded with `File successfully uploaded`. In contrast, the rest responded with an error message saying `Extension not allowed`.

## Non-Blacklisted Extensions

Now, we can try uploading a file using any of the `allowed extensions` from above, and some of them may allow us to execute PHP code. `Not all extensions will work with all web server configurations`, so we may need to try several extensions to get one that successfully executes PHP code.

Let's use the `.phtml` extension, which PHP web servers often allow for code execution rights. We can right-click on its request in the Intruder results and select `Send to Repeater`. Now, all we have to do is repeat what we have done in the previous two sections by changing the file name to use the `.phtml` extension and changing the content to that of a PHP web shell:

   

![HTTP POST request to /upload.php with file shell.phtml, response 200 OK, file successfully uploaded.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/136/file_uploads_php5_web_shell.jpg)

As we can see, our file seems to have indeed been uploaded. The final step is to visit our upload file, which should be under the image upload directory (`profile_images`), as we saw in the previous section. Then, we can test executing a command, which should confirm that we successfully bypassed the blacklist and uploaded our web shell:
